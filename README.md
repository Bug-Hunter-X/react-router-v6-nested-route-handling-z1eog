## Unexpected Routing Behavior in React Router v6

This repository demonstrates an unexpected routing behavior in React Router v6 when combining nested routes, path parameters, and wildcard routes.  The issue arises when a wildcard route (`*`) is present alongside nested routes that use path parameters.  In certain scenarios, the wildcard route may incorrectly match, resulting in the wrong component being rendered or components not rendering at all.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to different routes to observe the unexpected behavior.

### Expected Behavior

The application should render the correct components based on the URL. Specifically, nested routes with path parameters should take precedence over the wildcard route unless no other route matches.

### Actual Behavior

The wildcard route (`*`) often takes precedence over nested routes, leading to incorrect component rendering or missing components.

### Solution

The solution involves adjusting the order and structure of routes within the `Routes` component to ensure that more specific routes are evaluated before wildcard routes.  Refer to `AppSolution.js` for a corrected implementation.
